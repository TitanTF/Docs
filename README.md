# The Universe

This library documents all of the features found in the Titan Universe with great detail. You will discover the basics to get you started as a new player, as well as advanced tricks you can utilize if you are an expert.

This is a revised adaptation of the legacy documentation which was not well maintained. This is currently a big work in progress, expect the final product to differ.

With over 400K unique players from over 190 countries, we are a constantly evolving network of custom Team Fortress 2 servers available worldwide.

All of the features found in the Titan Universe are documented here with great detail. You will discover the basics to get you started as a new player, as well as advanced tricks you can utilize if you are an expert.

#### ‚ù§Ô∏è More than just another gaming community
There's always something for everyone. You will always find something new here at Titan. The journey never stops.

#### üòç You can start playing now for free
Creating an account is as easy as signing in with your Steam account or joining any one of our servers. Don't worry, we do not see any of your login details. Steam will only provide us your display name, avatar and Steam ID.

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Seamless integration with cloud data save synchronization
While browsing our website with the MOTD browser in a game, a session is automatically generated for you to access the website seamlessly. And when you update your loadout through the browser, the changes you make on the website loadout are automatically reflected in the game.

#### üìÇ Download and install our DLC to up your game
Our custom content is made completely optional for all players. No automatic downloads of any content for custom items when you connect. You can opt-in and enjoy the wide variety of content we offer by joining the content distributor server.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 16.14 or above (which can be checked by running node -v). You can use nvm for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
    - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Installation
```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```

### Local Development
```bash npm2yarn
cd Docs
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with.

The `npm run start` command builds the website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

The site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes when you edit the documentation.


### Build
This is not a necessary step to update the documentation. It builds the website into a directory of static contents and puts it on a web server so that it can be viewed. To build the website:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

## Credits
Built with ü¶ñ Docusaurus v2.
